      cmime_message_set_subject_encode() and 
      cmime_message_add_recipient_encode() to set and encode 
      non 7-bit header values. Resolves #8

    * Merged pull request #12, fix for random number generation.
    * Fixed create_mime_message_part_from_file.c example. New 
      message part was not added with cmime_message_append_part(), 
      so closing boundaries where broken. Resolves #11 

2017-01-24 Axel Steiner <ast@treibsand.com>
    * Fixed #6 
    * Fixed a bug in mimepart generation. If a new part was 
      added to a message,the content-type of the first one 
      was not generated based on the actual content. Instead 
      the content-type of the message was used. This is 
      related to #11

      on Mac OS X.

      build dir, to use a relative path in unit tests.
